<h1><i>My Summer Vacation</i></h1>

<h2>Moving Across Greenville</h2>

<p>In June I moved across town from<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greer,_South_Carolina"> Greer, SC</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenville,_South_Carolina">Greenville, SC</a>. It took two days to pack up, drive 20 minutes across town, and finally unload at our new home. Unloading and settling in was the most fun part of moving to my new house. We did a walk around to look and call out who had which room, and what went where. After arguing and more hard work we finally got unpacked and tried to get used to roaming around to different rooms. But, that wasnt a problem at all.</p>

<p>After about a week we were pretty settled and used to the new routine. We swam in the pool in our backyard, hung out in the tree house, and also got a four wheeler to ride around on our land! I had to get supplies and prepare for my new school that I was zoned for.</p2>

<h3>Volunteering At A Summer Camp</h3>

<p>Over the summer I volunteered at a summer camp I used to go to called Camp Greer. I had to put the lunches in to the fridge and clean the lunchroom in the morning. I had to obviously take help take care of the kids, Clean up the messy lunchroom after there messy lunch, and helped them with whatever they needed. My previous experiences with the camp had helped me because, I knew who people were. Also, I liked the fact that I didnt have to do it everyday. I do wish that my mom wouldnt have made me do that so I could stay at home like any other lazy 14 year old in the summer. But, because of her, and my little brother Riley it all happened.</p2>

<p>It wasnt bad and I actually didnt mind seeing my old friends, apart from waking up at 7:00AM and leaving at 7:15AM. Cleaning up after the kids was the worst part, especially Group 1. The hardest part about it was trying not to let my old friends get me banned by the camp supervisor, Mr. Justin. And the weird thing was that I actually got called a Mr. instead of just Ryan. Volunteering at my favorite summer camp wasnt the best thing of the summer but it was the most interesting.</p3>
